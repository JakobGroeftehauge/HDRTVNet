### Dataset
We conduct a dataset using videos under HDR10 standard and their counterpart SDR versions from Youtube. The dataset consists of a training set with 1235 image pairs and a test set with 117 image pairs. Please refer to the paper for the details on the processing of the dataset. The dataset can be downloaded from [[Baidu Netdisk]](https:) or [[Google Drive]](https:).

We also provide the original Youtube links of these videos, which can be found in this [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chxy95/HDRTVNet/master/links.txt). Note that we cannot provide the download links since we do not have the copyright to distribute. **Please download this dataset only for academic use.**

### Configuration
